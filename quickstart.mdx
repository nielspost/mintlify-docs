## Step 1: Create Your Workspace

Your workspace is command central—where everything ties back to your brand.

- Use your exact brand name. That’s what RankZero hunts for in AI responses.
- Add your main website domain. Make sure we’re tracking you, not just lookalikes.
- Select the region you want to run AI prompts from.
- Pick the AI platforms that matter to you—think ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google SGE—based on your plan.
- Heads-up: RankZero lists your brand with competitors for a true side-by-side look.

## Step 2: Add Your First Prompts

Prompts are the questions real people ask AI—and where you want your brand to appear in the answers.

- Head to “Prompts” in the sidebar.
- Start with 3–5 real-world questions you wish your customers were typing (and that AI platforms are actually getting).
  - Example: _Which tool helps remote teams manage projects on a budget?_
- Get a boost with suggested prompts—RankZero offers tailored starter questions based on your website and industry.
- Want more control? Add your own must-have prompts by typing them in directly.
