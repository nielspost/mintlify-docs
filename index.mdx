## Why Your Brand's Search Game Has Changed

People don't just type keywords into Google anymore. They ask questions straight to AI and trust what they hear back. Your brand's visibility gets decided in those AI answers—today, not tomorrow.

**RankZero makes sure you know exactly where you stand.**

## What RankZero Delivers for You

- **Uncover hidden citations**: Find when your hard work powers an answer, even if your name isn't upfront.
- **Track custom prompts**: Your questions, our tracking—see how AIs respond about you, every single day.
- **Monitor your competition**: Find out who's getting talked about and how often.
- **Spot missed chances**: Learn where your content is referenced but your brand isn't called out. Fix it fast.

## How RankZero Works
