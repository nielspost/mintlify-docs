This isn't traditional SEO keyword tracking. Your results take time to become statistically meaningful, and data may vary day-to-day since AI models are inherently random.

## Why Prompts Matter

AI models don't rely on keywords—people ask full questions. Instead of searching "best project management tool," they ask "What's the best project management tool for remote teams under \$50 per month?"

Visibility in AI means appearing in those conversations either as a named brand or by having your content used or cited.

Prompts simulate real questions your audience asks. RankZero runs them across multiple AI models once every 24 hours, giving you fresh insights on how ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews respond and who they highlight.
