RankZero automatically refreshes your data once per dayâ€”everything you see reflects aggregated results from the most recent prompt run.

<Info>
  **Note:** In some cases, a domain's visibility score can exceed 100%. This happens when multiple URLs from the same domain are used as sources in a single AI response. When this occurs, the domain is overrepresented because it contributes more than once to the result, leading to a visibility score above 100%.

## Why Sources Matter

When AI models generate responses, they pull information from various websites across the internet. Understanding these sources helps you:

- **Identify trusted content:** See which websites AI models cite most frequently
- **Find optimization opportunities:** Discover if your content appears in sources but isn't being cited directly in AI answers
- **Track competitive sources:** Monitor which websites your competitors use or appear on

**Important:** A source can be used without being cited. Your content might contribute to an AI's response even if it's not explicitly referenced in the final answer.

## How to Use Source Insights

Source data helps you make strategic decisions about your content and outreach:

- **Find partnership opportunities:** Identify high-performing sources where you might want to get your brand mentioned
- **Improve your content strategy:** Learn from successful sources to improve how you structure and present your information
- **Discover content gaps:** See what topics and formats perform well that you might be missing
