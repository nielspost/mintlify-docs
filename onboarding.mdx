# RankZero Onboarding Documentation

AI search is here. Your customers are asking ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews for recommendations. If RankZero isn't tracking your brand, AI isn't seeing you.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Workspace

Create your workspace to start tracking AI visibility.

**Brand Name**

- Enter your exact brand name as it appears publicly
- Example: Use "Acme Co." if that's your official name
- This is what RankZero searches for across AI platforms

**Website**

- Enter your primary website URL
- RankZero uses this to identify your official content and distinguish it from competitors

**Location**

- Select your primary country or region
- This setting determines how RankZero simulates AI searches from your target audience's location

**Note:** Your brand will appear alongside competitors in results. This provides an accurate view of how AI platforms present your brand in context.

## Step 2: Add Your First Prompts

Define the questions your customers ask AI about your industry.

**Getting Started**

- Add 3-5 prompts that reflect real customer questions
- Format: "What's the best [your product] for [situation]?"
- Use RankZero's auto-generated suggestions based on your website and industry
- Create custom prompts for specific buying journeys or keyword targets

**Example Prompts:**

- "Which project management tool is best for startups?"
- "What software helps remote teams manage deadlines?"

## Step 3: Add Competitors

Track your competitive landscape in AI search results.

**Setup Process**

- Add direct competitors you want to monitor
- Your brand is included automatically as a benchmark
- Compare who gets mentioned and who gets cited as a trusted source

**Results View**

- See side-by-side comparisons of all brands
- Track mentions, citations, and rankings
- Identify gaps where competitors appear but you don't
