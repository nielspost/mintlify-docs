AI search is here. Your customers are asking ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews for recommendations. If RankZero isn't tracking your brand, AI isn't seeing you.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Workspace

Create your workspace to start tracking AI visibility.

**Brand Name**

- Enter your exact brand name as it appears publicly
- Example: Use "Acme Co." if that's your official name

**Website**

- Enter your primary website URL
- RankZero uses this to identify your official content and distinguish it from competitors

**Location**

- Select your primary country or region
- This setting determines how RankZero simulates AI searches from your target audience's location

**Note:** Your brand will appear alongside competitors in results. This provides an accurate view of how AI platforms present your brand in context.

## Step 2: Add Your First Prompts

Define the questions your customers ask AI about your industry.
