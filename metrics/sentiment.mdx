The sentiment score measures the overall tone of a prompt's response on a scale from 0 to 100. Most scores fall between 65 and 85. A score near 85 indicates clearly positive language—words like "trusted," "reliable," or "innovative." Around 65 represents neutral or factual language with little emotional tone. Anything below 65 generally signals language that could be critical or negative and typically warrants a closer look.

## Understanding Sentiment Scores

- **85-100:** Clearly positive language—"trusted," "reliable," "innovative"
- **65-84:** Neutral or factual tone with little emotional language
- **0-64:** Critical or negative language that needs your attention

Most brands score between 65-85. Anything below 65 signals potential reputation issues.

## Why Sentiment Matters

AI doesn't just mention brands—it makes judgments about them. Your sentiment score reveals whether AI portrays your brand positively or raises red flags for potential customers.

**Positive sentiment drives conversions. Negative sentiment kills them.**
