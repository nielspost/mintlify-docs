  **Note:** A source can be used silently (informing the AI's answer) or cited visibly (appearing in the response). Your domain or URLs can contribute to responses even when not explicitly referenced.

Citations track when AI explicitly credits your content in responses. This is your most direct form of attributionâ€”when AI not only uses your content but actually references it.

## What Citations Include

RankZero monitors all explicit citations across AI platforms:

- **Direct citations:** Your content is explicitly referenced in the response
- **Citation frequency:** How many times you're cited per response
- **Citation context:** Where and how your content is referenced

## Why Citations Matter

Citations are AI's endorsement of your content. They signal trust, authority, and relevance. Citations drive traffic and establish your brand as a credible source.

**Citations turn AI responses into referral engines. Citations are the AI version of backlinks in SEO.**

## Reading Your Citations Data

- **Average citations per response:** How frequently you're cited when AI uses your content
