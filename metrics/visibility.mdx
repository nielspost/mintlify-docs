Your visibility score shows how often your brand appears in AI responses. This is the percentage of prompts where AI platforms mention your brand by name.

Now that you've set up prompts and competitors, let's understand what the data means.

## What Visibility Means

When someone asks ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Google AI Overviews a question in your industry, visibility tracks whether your brand gets named in the answer.

- **High visibility:** Your brand appears in most AI responses
- **Low visibility:** AI rarely mentions your brand
- **Zero visibility:** You're invisible to AI search

RankZero tracks two main types of visibility: when your brand is mentioned and when your content is used as a source.

Each type has different metrics that help you understand your performance.

## Brand Visibility vs Source Visibility

Understanding the difference between these two is critical:

- **Brand visibility:** Your brand is explicitly mentioned in the response
- **Source visibility:** Your domain or content was used or cited—even if your brand isn't named

You can be visible as a source without being visible as a brand. And you can be mentioned as a brand without your website being used.

RankZero tracks both so you can spot gaps. For example:

- If you're cited often but never mentioned, it might mean your brand lacks authority or name recognition
- If you're mentioned often but never cited, AI might associate your name with a topic, but not trust your content as a reference

## Why Visibility Matters

AI search changed the rules. Traditional SEO rankings don't matter if AI doesn't know your brand exists. Your visibility score tells you exactly how often potential customers see your name when they ask AI for recommendations.

> **If AI can't find you, your customers can't either.**

## Reading Your Visibility Data

- **Percentage score:** Shows how often your brand appears (e.g., 45% means your brand was mentioned in 45% of AI responses)
- **Trend lines:** Track whether your visibility is growing or shrinking over time
- **Competitor comparison:** See how your visibility stacks up against rivals

## Improving Your Visibility

- Add more targeted prompts that match customer questions
- Create content that directly answers common industry questions
- Monitor competitor visibility to identify gaps you can fill
- Track changes after publishing new content or making website updates

**Get seen in AI answers. Don't just compete—be the brand AI recommends.**
