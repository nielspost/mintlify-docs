Mentions go beyond just countingâ€”it shows you the context, position, and frequency of your brand appearances.

## What Mentions Include

RankZero captures every brand mention across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews:

- **Direct mentions:** Your brand name appears explicitly
- **Position tracking:** Whether you're mentioned first, second, or further down
- **Context analysis:** How your brand is discussed in each response
- **Frequency data:** How many times you're mentioned per response

## Why Mentions Matter

Position matters in AI responses. Being mentioned first carries more weight than being listed fifth. Mentions data shows you exactly where you stand in AI's recommendations.

## Reading Your Mentions Data

- **Total mentions:** Raw count of how many times your brand appeared
- **Average position:** Where your brand typically ranks in AI responses
- **Mention context:** View actual AI responses where your brand was named
- **Competitor mentions:** See who else gets mentioned alongside you

## Improving Your Mentions

- Target prompts where competitors currently dominate
- Create content that positions your brand as the obvious choice
- Monitor mention patterns to understand what triggers AI recommendations
- Track position changes after content updates or new launches

**Be the name AI says first. Position matters more than you think.**

## Where to Analyze Your Metrics

You can view your brand and source metrics at different levels:

- **Dashboard:** Aggregated view across all prompts and competitors
- **Prompts page:** Individual prompt performance and trends
- **Sources page:** Source analysis with URL and domain views
- **By tags:** Filter any view by prompt categories to analyze specific themes

**Track what matters. See where you're winning and where you're losing ground.**
