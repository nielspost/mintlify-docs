This tracks your invisible influence on AI answers, even when your brand isn't mentioned. 

## What Usage Percentage Means

AI pulls information from across the web to generate responses. Usage percentage reveals how often your content contributes to those answers:

- **High usage:** Your content frequently powers AI responses
- **Low usage:** AI rarely uses your content as a source
- **Zero usage:** Your content doesn't influence AI answers

## Why Usage Matters

You can influence AI responses without getting brand credit. High usage with low mentions suggests your content is valuable but your brand needs stronger recognition.

## Reading Your Usage Data

- **Domain usage:** How often your website contributes to AI responses
- **URL-level usage:** Which specific pages AI uses most frequently
- **Usage trends:** Track whether AI is using your content more or less over time
- **Competitor usage:** See whose content AI trusts most in your industry

## Improving Your Usage

- Create comprehensive content that answers complete questions
- Structure content in formats AI can easily parse and use
- Build authority signals that make AI trust your content
- Monitor which content types get used most frequently
